Armysets are in here. Each armyset consists of a set of army descriptions, a
name, a size and a unique(!!) id.

Mask and image files need to have the same name as the armyset description file
and have to be .png files.

The currently used indexes are:

1 - default 
2 - big default 
3 - duel

All indexes above 3 are free as of now.
