Armysets are in here. Each armyset consists of a set of army descriptions, a
name, a size and a unique(!!) id.

Furthermore, each armyset contains an image (40*(#armies) x 40 currently) and
a mask to map player colors. The mask has to be an image with indexed palette;
For the colors to be used, see the comments in player.cpp (function
Player::initPalette).
Mask and image files need to have the same name as the armyset description file
and have to be .png files.

The currently used indexes are:

1 - default 
2 - big default 

All indexes above 2 are free as of now.
