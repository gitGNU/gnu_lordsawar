The xslt files in this directory assist in the backward compatibility.
These files help this software support old versions of various files.

Each xslt file helps to advance a particular LordsAWar! file type from and older version to a newer version.

Each xslt file name in this directory has the following form:
[code]-[old version]-[new version].xsl

Where [code] is one of:
c     - primary configuration file
il    - item description file
pl    - profiles file
rpg   - recently played games file
gl    - recently hosted or recently advertised games file
pbm   - play by mail turn file
ref   - recently edited documents file
as    - armyset file
ts    - tileset file
cs    - cityset file
ss    - shieldset file
gs    - map or saved-game file

Each version looks like 0.2.0, or 0.1.9, etc.

Some of these xslt files operate on xml files found in ~/.lordsawar/.  Some xml files also appear inside of armyset, tileset, cityset, shieldset, map and saved-game files.  (These files are all implemented as tar files, and are normally found in ~/.lordsawar/, and ${PREFIX}/share/lordsawar/).
The primary configuration file refers to the xml file located at ~/.lordsawarrc.

See the lordsawar-upgrade-file program for more information on how to upgrade files.
