Most (all?) item pics here are stolen from wesnoth. They have not been fully
integrated yet, mostly it is just the images that are lying around.
This file states some ideas sent together with the items.
Rarity has not been implemented (items are not yet handed out except if the
scenario says so), some of the modifications are also missing (+gold for example).
