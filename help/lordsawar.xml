	<title>Prologue</title> 
	<para>
The entire realm is holding its breath -- war is coming, and the citizens know what that means; cities will be sacked, towns will be looted, and flags will be raised.  There will be a shortage of food supplies, high taxes, and fire burning on the horizon, if not even closer.  The best thing to do is to join the army before getting drafted.  
</para>

	<para>
Several factions will vie for total control of the realm.  Talented generals will be needed to lead forces against the enemy.  Plans will be made, and lands will be conquered.  Heroes will emerge to fight on behalf of their general.  Large seige engines will be constructed and rolled to distant cities.  Great ships of war will take to the seas.   Infantry units will be sent to the front line to face the enemy in battle.
	</para>

	<para>
The future is uncertain.  The lords of the realm are warring.  The lords are a-war.

	<title>Introduction</title> 
	<para>
&app; is a turn-based strategy game where up to eight players strive to conquer all of the cities on the map.  The player has three distinct roles in the game:

	  <orderedlist>
		<listitem>
The player acts as a General who controls all of military strategy elements of the game; moving armies around the map, conquering cities and managing the production of new army units.
</listitem>
<listitem>
The player acts as a diplomatic envoy, managing diplomatic relations with every other player.
</listitem>
<listitem>
The player acts as a tax collector, automatically collecting gold pieces from each city that has been conquered.  This pays for the maintenance of army units already created.  The income can also be used to buy new and different kinds of army units.
</listitem>
	  </orderedlist>
</para>
<para>
Army units are arranged into stacks of up to eight.  Stacks are moved around the map through varying terrain; forest, hills, swamp, or water.  Each of the varying kinds of terrain cost the stack some of its movement points.  Some stacks may even have the ability to fly over troublesome mountains.  
</para>

<para>
Some army units are special Hero units.  Heroes sometimes emerge spontaneously in cities at the start of the player's turn.  Heroes can search ruins to obtain gold pieces or magical items, or go on special quests.  Powerful allies often accompany a hero.
</para>

<para>
The objective of the game is to conquer all of the cities on the map.  This is accomplished by producing army units in cities and making ever more powerful stacks to conquer neighbouring cities.  Strategy is employed to know which city, or player to target next, on the way to total victory.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="lordsawar-cities"> 
	<title>Cities</title> 
<para>
Cities are important because conquering cities is the key to winning the game.  Each player typically starts with one city, with the remainder of the cities being unowned.  Each city can produce army units that the player can use to attack other cities.  Each player has a capital city that other players can target and take over for bragging rights.
</para>
<sect2 id="lordsawar-cities-what-are-they">
	<title>What are they?</title> 
<para>
Cities appear as castles on the map display; they occupy four tiles on the screen; a two-by-two square.  Cities appear as little shields on the miniature map.
</para>

<para>
Cities have a name, a defense level, and they provide a number of gold pieces to the player's treasury every turn.
</para>
<para>
The income is in the form of gold pieces, which happens to be exactly what army units require as their upkeep.  Conquering more cities gives the player more money and enables the upkeep of more army units.
</para>
<para>
The defense level for the city is not important and is ignored by all battle calculations.
</para>
<para>
Each city can produce one of up to four different army unit types.  After enough turns have passed the army unit shows up in the city and can be moved around the map as the player sees fit.  Changing a city's production of army units is one of the main ways that a player affects the outcome of the game.  The player can also choose to add a new army unit type to the suite of army unit types that the city can produce; which can cost a lot of gold pieces.
</para>
<para>
Army unit production can be viewed and modified in cities that the player owns.  The production in enemy cities can also be viewed if the game is started with the "view production" option turned on.
</para>
<para>
Movement in a city that the player owns is the same as moving on a road; it is the easiest mode of transportation.  Cities that are adjacent to the water act as a port; a jumping-off point for naval operations.
</para>
<para>
Army units located in the city fight as a single force when the city is attacked by the enemy.  Some army units will have a special fighting bonus if they are defending a city, or attacking a city.  To attack a city, move your army units to an adjacent tile and then attempt to move into the city.
</para>

<para>
Army units may not move through a foreign city without conquering it first.
