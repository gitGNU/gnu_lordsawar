.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool converts Warlords II .SCZ files into LordsAWar! map files.  Alternatively this tool can operate on a directory that contains the unpacked SCZ file.  In particular, the directory must contain .SCN, .RD .MAP and .SGN files.

No attempt is made to import the graphics from the Warlords scenario.

Unfortunately this tool does not import the contents of cities -- the cities themselves will be imported, but they won't have any armies that can be produced.  Ruin defenders are not imported, and neither are the rewards (items) that can be found inside ruins.

This tool does not support converting .SZP files, or saved game files.

The resulting file is saved as the basename of your FILE or directory, with a .map extension added.  For example, if you converted a directory called ERYTHEA/, the converted file will be called ERYTHEA.map.
