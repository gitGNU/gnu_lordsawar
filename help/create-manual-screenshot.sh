# The approach here is to bring lordsawar to the foreground and then
# take a screenshot of it.
# the import program from imagemagick takes a screenshot of the active
# window, and then we dump the name of the file it created.
#
# it takes time to bring the window to the foreground, so we wait half
# a second before taking the screenshot.
#
# unfortunately the top bar needs to be taken into account, and it may
# be a different size on your system.
# also the size of the window can be different depending on your fonts.
# so you'll have to play with these values:
# -crop 882x646+0+33 
# my bar is 33 pixels tall, and the lordsawar window *with a unit selected*
# is 882 pixels wide and 646 pixels tall.
#
# if i could find a way to automatically find the size of the top bar, i'd
# do that.
