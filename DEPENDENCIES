The configure script should check for all these libs, but nevertheless here is
a list of the dependencies.

Requirements:

- paragui = 1.1.8
	to be found under http://www.paragui.org
    (take the latest version due to some necessary bug fixes)

- SDL >= 1.2.0	
	to be found under http://www.libsdl.org

- SDL_image >= 1.2.0
    there should be a link on the sdl home page

- SDL_mixer >= 1.2.6
    there should be a link on the sdl home page

- expat
    an XML parser to be found under http://expat.sf.net, also comes with the
    paragui source distribution (enable with configure --enable-internal-expat)

- libsigc++ >= 1.2.0
	to be found under libsigc.sf.net
	don't know if libsigc++-1.0 also works, but it had some design flaws
	according to the documentation, so take the latest. Don't use version 2.0!
    AFAIR it is incompatible with 1.2.

- pkg-config
    Should be distributed with the Linux distribution. Required for detecting
    the libsigc++-package and -flags

- Gnu gettext 
    Should be distributed with the Linux distribution.

- Pthread library
    Should be distributed with the Linux distribution.

Optional requirements (for now):

- ggz-client-libs : FL needs the 'ggzmod'  library, and the 'ggz-config' tool
- ggz-server      : FL needs the 'ggzdmod' library, and the server config path
- libggz          : FL needs the 'libggz'  library by itself
    


Requirements for freelords-autopack.sh (neccessary only for admins etc. :)):

- must be outside of "freelords_sdl" ie. "/home/cvs/freelords_sdl", then the
script must be in "/home/cvs"
- need ncftpput, you can get ncftp at http://www.ncftp.com
