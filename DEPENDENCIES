The configure script should check for all these libs, but nevertheless here is
a list of the dependencies.

Requirements:

- gtkmm and libglade == 2.4

- SDL >= 1.2.0	
	to be found under http://www.libsdl.org

- SDL_image >= 1.2.0
    there should be a link on the sdl home page

- SDL_mixer >= 1.2.6
    there should be a link on the sdl home page

- expat
    an XML parser to be found under http://expat.sf.net, also comes with the
    paragui source distribution (enable with configure --enable-internal-expat)

- libsigc++ >= 2.0
	to be found under libsigc.sf.net

- pkg-config
    Should be distributed with the Linux distribution. Required for detecting
    the libsigc++-package and -flags

- GNU gettext 
    Should be distributed with the Linux distribution.

- Pthread library

Optional requirements (for now):

- ggz-server      : FL needs the 'ggzdmod' library, and the server config path
- libggz          : FL needs the 'libggz'  library by itself
