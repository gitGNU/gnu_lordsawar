	* finished implementing the item dialog (it is drag and drop,

	  is buggy); finished implementing the equipment action as well

	* added scrolling through items to ItemDialog

2006-12-15  ulf82

	* applied two patches by Ben Asselstine (mountain images and show
	  gold after pillaging), updated maps to new savegame version,
	  ItemDialog now has capability to show item abilities on

	  here).
