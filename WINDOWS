Cross-compiling LordsAWar! for Windows on Fedora 22

$ sudo yum install intltool automake autoconf m4 git libtool glib2-devel mingw-w64-tools mingw64-gcc-c++ mingw64-libarchive mingw64-cairomm mingw64-libsigc++20 mingw64-gettext mingw64-libxslt mingw64-libxml++ mingw64-gtkmm30

$ git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/lordsawar.git

$ cd lordsawar

$ ./autogen.sh

$ mingw64-configure --disable-gls --disable-ghs --enable-sound=no --program-prefix=""

$ LORDSAWAR_DATADIR="." make -e -j4

$ sudo make install

The approach here is to set the datadir to ".", so that we can put all of the data files in the same directory as the exe.  Compiling "." as the datadir into the program means that the default configuration file will be written with this path -- and the data files will be found on the first run without the user having to manually munge the .lordsawarrc file.

Sound is disabled because Fedora lacks a mingw-compiled gstreamermm package.
