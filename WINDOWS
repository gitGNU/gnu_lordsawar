Cross-compiling LordsAWar! for Windows on Fedora 22

$ sudo yum install intltool automake autoconf m4 git libtool glib2-devel mingw32-filesystem mingw32-gcc-c++ mingw32-libarchive mingw32-cairomm mingw32-libsigc++20 mingw32-gettext mingw32-libxslt mingw32-libxml++ mingw32-gtkmm30

$ git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/lordsawar.git

$ cd lordsawar

$ ./autogen.sh

$ mingw32-configure --disable-gls --disable-ghs --disable-sound --program-prefix=""

$ LDFLAGS="-mwindows" LORDSAWAR_DATADIR="." make -e -j4

$ sudo make install

The approach here is to set the datadir to ".", so that we can put all of the data files in the same directory as the exe.  Compiling "." as the datadir into the program means that the default configuration file will be written with this path -- and the data files will be found on the first run without the user having to manually munge the .lordsawarrc file.

The LDFLAGS="-mwindows" ensures that we run our .exe without a terminal.

Sound is disabled because Fedora lacks a mingw-compiled gstreamermm package.


mingw-bundledlls is used to collect up the required DLLs for the lordsawar.exe executable.  It can be downloaded here: https://github.com/mpreisler/mingw-bundledlls 

Put it in your path, and make it executable.

The DLL blacklist for the program is:
    "advapi32.dll", "kernel32.dll", "msvcrt.dll", "ole32.dll", "user32.dll",
    "ws2_32.dll", "comdlg32.dll", "gdi32.dll", "imm32.dll", "oleaut32.dll",
    "shell32.dll", "winmm.dll", "winspool.drv", "wldap32.dll",
    "ntdll.dll", "dnsapi.dll", "iphlpapi.dll", "shlwapi.dll", "msimg32.dll",
    "gdiplus.dll", "usp10.dll", "comctl32.dll"

To make mingw-bundledlls use this blacklist you have to modify the program.  Open the file and change the blacklist array at line 37.

Finally, we're ready to make a windows zip file that contains the game, the editor, the DLLS, the gnome icons, and all of our game data.
$ ./make-windows-zip.sh

It makes use the of mingw-bundledlls and the copy-gnome-icons.sh script.
When it completes, you will have a lordsawar-windows.zip file.
