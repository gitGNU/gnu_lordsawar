This document describes the format of a lordsawar save game. 


The save game files are in XML. The tags are displayed here as they appear 
in the save game.  The text in between the tags are comments.  There are 
two kinds of tags:

- tags to structure the savefile
- data tags

The first kind of tags defines a structure for the savegames, which is 
important when loading it. The latter tags actually store the data. As 
an example, here is a draft of the list of players:

<playerlist>
    <player>
        <d_id>      player's Id     </d_id>
        <d_name>    player's name   </d_name>
        ...
    </player>
    <player>
    ...
    </player>
    ...
</playerlist>

The player tags here enclose the definition of a single player. The 
actual name etc. of these players are stored within data tags. Data 
tags always start with a "d_".

Order of the data tags does not matter, but the order of the sections
does matter.

The version of the savegame is encoded in the first opening "lordsawar" tag.

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<lordsawar version="xxx">
    <counter>
        <d_curID>   This value should be always higher than the largest Id that
                    has been assigned since new Id's will be assigned from this
                    value on.
                    Unique successive Ids are given to newly created game 
                    objects, and this value holds the next Id to assign.

                            These Ids line up with order of armies in
