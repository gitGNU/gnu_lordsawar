1. Introduction
---------------

Warlords 2 has a description of each city.

In the default scenario the descriptions seem to be hand-written.

These descriptions can be seen in your own cities, and in enemy cities too, (if we can view enemy production or not).

They add to the charm of the game, and elements of history, and of a story can be added to the scenario using these hand-written descriptions.

In the randomly generated maps, the city descriptions are assembled programmatically.  Partly randomly, and partly due to the characteristics of the city or nearby terrain features.

This approach of assembling sentences works okay for english, but not so much for other languages.

2. How city descriptions relate to changes in the LordsAWar! codebase
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently in LordsAWar! cities do not have descriptions, because of the way it lowers the quality of non-english translations of the game.   If the descriptions were to be added in a way that doesn't ghettoize non-english languages, the following steps would have to be taken:
1. The city window needs to be modified so that there's a place for the description.  
2. We need to be able to click on an enemy city even when the view enemy production option is turned off.  
3. The City editor dialog in the scenario editor needs to be modified to show and allow the editing of this description.
4. The scenario editor also needs the ability to randomize the city description.
5. CreateScenario needs to be modified to randomize the city descriptions too.
6. Need to add a backwards compatibility path for scenarios without city descriptions.
7. Modify 2ndpunic and dol scenarios.
