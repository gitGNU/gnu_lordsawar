/** Snd class
  * 
  * The purpose of putting the sound code into one class is (besides hiding the
  * internals and supplying a friendly interface) to put all these ugly ifdefs
  * in one place (sound can be disabled for fewer dependencies).
  *
  * @note: As this becomes too complicated, I throw away the caching stuff.
  *
  * Sound and music are treated a bit differently since the mixer calls are others.
  * However, both are referenced by strings (I think in this case, id's aren't
  * very readable). There are basically two types of music. Background music
  * is enabled by enableBackground(). It will always play until disabled again
  * by looking through the databse of available background music pieces. On top
  * of that, it is possible to play other music pieces. In this case, the
  * background music fades out (maybe), the other music fades or pops in
  * and goes away again with the background music taking its place again
  * afterwards.
