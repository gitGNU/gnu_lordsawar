/** This class creates a map including the buildings (cities, ruins, temples).
  * It does NOT care about player setup and such. This is done in a second step
  * by the CreateScenario class. The parameters for map creation are set by
  * GamePreferencesDialog::fillData().
  * GamePreferencesDialog does use the MapConfDialog but this is
  * just a skeleton - GamePreferencesDialog does all the work.
  *
  * The data is stored in two variables:
  *   - the terrain map stores the terrain information
  *   - the building map stores the information about building placement
  *
  * For historical reasons *cough*, the maps are long character arrays. The
  * definition of the single characters can be found further down; missing
  * buildings are denoted by a space. As a normal user, you will propably never
  * need to worry about the format anyway. It is read and "translated" by the
  * CreateScenario class which kind of supervises the scenario creation.
  *
  * Map generators with different styles (e.g. islands), derived from
  * this class are possible and will hpefully be done in the
  * future. 
  * 
  * When designating sites for cities, it takes care to ensure that 
  * the first cities on any land mass will be ports on those seas
  * that connect with other land masses and islands. In doing so, it
  * creates two data structures that may be useful elsewhere.
