/**
 * Players vie for control of City objects on the game map.  The main goal
 * of the game is to conquer these City objects.  Cities can be also be razed,
 * making them uninhabitable and unconquerable.
 *
 * A city can produce armies, provide income, place produced armies on it's 
 * tiles and buy production as well as have it's name changed.  Cities can
 * also vector their produced units to another position on the map.
 *
 * A City has 4 production slots.  A production slot is a production 
 * capability of a city.  Every one of the slots can be filled with an 
 * Army production base.  Cities can be assigned a random set of Army
 * production bases.  The name of a City can also be randomly set from a 
 * list of potential City names.
 *
 * Some City objects are capital cities.  Every player has a single capital
 * city.  Conquering another player's capital city doesn't give any bonus
 * except for bragging rights.
