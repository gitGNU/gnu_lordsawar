/** A city on the game map
  * 
  * The City class includes the whole functionality of a city on the game map. A
  * city can produce armies, place produced armies on its fields and buy
  * production as well as be upgraded.
  *
  * Upgrading affects the city in several ways:
  * - more production can be bought
  * - the city produces more gold
  * - units defending the city get a defense bonus
  *
  * Some other things to mention are basic production and the system of
  * production slots.
  *
  * A production slot is a production capability of a city. If a city has 4
  * different production slots, it may choose its production from a maximum of 4
  * different units. The slots are divided into basic production slots (only
  * filled by units of the default armyset).
