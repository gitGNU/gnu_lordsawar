//! A more complex artificial intelligence Player.
/** 
 * After examining if it buys additional production, this AI uses the classical
 * strategy technique of:
 * - analyse the game situation - this involves identifying stacks and cities as
 *   threats, and deciding which are the greatest threats to which cities.
 * - allocate resources to deal with the threats to our best advantage.
 *
 * TODO:  Ruins are also identified as threats, though they are not handled yet.
 * TODO:  The Ai only buys basic productions
 * TODO:  The AI doesn't rally make use of the multifight, and it cannot really
 * handle the results (not checked)
 * TODO:  The Ai should be able to upgrade cities (Increases their income etc.)
 * TODO:  AI is way too defensive (in fact, the fast AI tends to win games)
 *
 * The code is split up in several classes. Be sure to read the comments there
 * before trying to read the code. :)
 *
 * - AI_Analysis includes the code for the assessment of the game situation
 * - AI_Allocation distributes the AI's ressources the engage threats
 * - Threat/Threatlist contains the code for the definition of single threats
 *   and the container class for threats
 * - AICityInfo is used to collect the threats and reinforcements etc. of a
 *   single city of the AI.
 *
 * Also see the Player class for the derivation scheme of players.
