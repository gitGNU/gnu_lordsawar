The editor is currently in the earliest possible alpha stage. If you create
a map, it is perfectly possible that it is not playable at all.

TODO (trying to go from the simplest to the more difficult things):

- create basic design                                       (done)
- ability to create a new map (incomplete, but
  without inconsistencies, e.g. supply neutral player)      (done)
- ability to use MapGenerator to create a map               (done)
- change terrain (different area covering!)                 (done)
    - better images for the area covering buttons
- saving and loading                                        (done)
- place cities, temples, ruins and remove them              (done)
- ability to use MapGenerator to place cities etc.          (done)
- modify cities, temples, ruins                             (done)
- modify stacks                                             (done)
- place stacks                                              (done)
- resolve items being stacked (e.g. stack on ruin)          (done)
- add + modify players                                      (done)
- find items on the map by id                               (done)
- create and modify events                                  (done)
- move objects
- distribute items
- reports(city, stacks, temples, ruins)
- keyboard support (always refresh!)
- improve layout and handling (look for TODO: in the code)
- translation check and comments etc.
- advanced setup:
    - assign quests
    - area selection + drag'n drop (?)
    - make event dialogs non-modal, so user can look up id's
