/** Class which describes a threat to a player.
  *
  * The smart AI player tries to assess all enemy stacks and cities and all
  * ruins and store the results in threats. A threat has three characteristic
  * figures:
  *
  * - a strength which determines how strong the stack (or the stacks defending
  *   the city) are
  * - a danger which determines how close the enemy object is (if an enemy stack
  *   endangers two cities at once, the danger value doubles). The danger depends
  *   on the distance to the AI's cities as well as the strength of the stack.
  * - a value, which gives an assessment of how valuable it is to destroy the
  *   threat. As an example, taking over a dangerous enemy city is more valuable
  *   than destroying a stack because the AI gets an additional city. The value
  *   is the sum of the danger of the threat and some additional bonus.
  *
  * Furthermore, the threat class has some additional functions. They are e.g.
  * neccessary because the AI bundles several stacks which are close together
  * or a stack which is in an enemy city to one single threat.
  *
  * For more information about the smart AI, see ai_smart.h
