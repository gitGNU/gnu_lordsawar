/** This class is intended to make xml handling easier. It offers
  * save and load functions. You can initialise it either with a filename or
  * a stream (to make dumping data also possible)
  *
  * Saving works like this:
  * Open a new tag with openTag(), save your data with saveData() and close the
  * tag with closeTag(). The output will look like:
  *
  * <map>
  *     <maptile>
  *         <d_x> 50 </d_x>
  *         <d_y> 10 </d_y>
  *         <d_type> 5 </d_type>
  *     </maptile>
  *     ...
  * </map>
  *
  * map and maptile are opened tags, the tags x, y and type are saved data.
  * ATTENTION: Always save data before you start opening up subtags!!!
  * i.e. if you want to save some data concerning the tag map, save it _before_
  * you open the first subtag (here maptile).
  *
  * The save code in LordsAWar follows a top-down hierarchy. As an example,
  * The player's stacklist saves its data first, then calls
  * the save functions of all the stacks. The stacks themselves call the save
  * functions of their armies when they have stored their own data. The topmost
  * object in the hierarchy is the GameScenario instance.
  * 
  * Loading:
  * First, you supply xml_helper with callback functions via registerTag.
  * You can also unregister these functions with unregisterTag, but usually this
  * isn't neccessary.
  *
  * When you are ready, call parse. The parser will start until it finds a special
  * tag (not starting with d_). It will then parse the next tags, assuming that
  * these are data tags, until it finds the next special tag. When this is
  * reached, it stops and calls the callback for the former special tag. 
  * Sometimes (e.g. in the case of a ruin being created and a stack tag) this
  * callback will set up the callback for the next tag and demand some data.
  * This data has already been stored and will be supplied on a request of
  * getData(). That's all.
  *
  * Loading is also implemented in a hierarchical way. In the example above, the
  * stacklist constructor is initialised with the XML_Helper instance. Then it
  * registers an internal stacklist function as callback for the "stack" tags.
  * This function is started when the first stack tag is encountered and creates
  * a new Stack instance with the XML_Helper instance ...
  *
  * If this explanation was confusing, have a look at the loading and saving
  * functions. They should make the point somewhat clearer.
