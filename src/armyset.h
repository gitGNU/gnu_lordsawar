/**
 * An Armyset is a complete set of Army prototype objects.  An Army prototype
 * is a kind of Army, as opposed to an Army unit instance (e.g. on the game
 * map).  See the Army class for more information about what an Army prototype
 * is.  The Armyset describes the size of the graphic tiles that each Army 
 * graphic occupies on the screen (Army::d_tilesize).
 * There special images are kept with the Armyset:  the ship picture, the
 * planted standard picture, and the bag of items picture.
 *
 * The ship picture is what the Stack looks like when it is in a boat.
 * The planted standard is what the player's standard looks like when it has
 * been planted in the ground.  The bag of items picture is what it looks like
 * when a hero has dropped an item on the ground.
 *
 * Armysets are most often referred to by their Id (Armyset::d_id), but may 
 * sometimes be referred to by their name (Armyset::d_name) or basename 
 * name (Armyset::d_basename).
 *
 * Armyset objects are loaded from an armyset configuration file.
 *
 * Armyset objects are created by the armyset editor.
 *
 * Every Player has an Armyset that dictates the characteristics of the
 * player's forces, but in practise there is only one Armyset per scenario.
 *
 * The armyset configuration file is a tar file that contains an XML file, 
 * and a set of png files.  Filenames have the following form:
 * army/${Armyset::d_basename}.lwa.
