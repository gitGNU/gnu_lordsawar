/** This class describes an item.
  * 
  * Items are defined by three values. They have a type, which determines where
  * they may be worn (Weapon, Shield, Accessoire etc.), a bonus which determines
  * what goods they bring to their wielder (strength, defense, army bonus etc.)
  * and a value which tells how much the stat is raised or what boni the user
  * gets.
  *
  * @note Items occur on two places. First, there is an itemlist which holds
  * templates of all available items. They can be identified by an id of 0.
  * Second, there are items in the actual game, which are gained by cloning an
  * item from the itemlist.
  *
  * @note Items should have not more than three boni. If they give an army or
  * movement bonus, just count each of the boni as one bonus.
