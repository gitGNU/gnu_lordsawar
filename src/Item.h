/** 
 * This class describes an item.  Items are carried by heroes in a backpack.
 * When Items are carried they give special abilities to that hero, and 
 * perhaps the stack it is included in.
 * Items can be dropped onto the ground, and picked up from the ground.
 * When a hero dies, all of that hero's items get dropped onto the ground.
 *
 * There are "plantable items", that a hero can stick into the ground.  This
 * gives the ability to vector Army units to that location.  Every player
 * gets a plantable item, and the item is branded to be usable only by the
 * player that it belongs to.
