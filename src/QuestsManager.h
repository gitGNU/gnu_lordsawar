//! Manages Quest objects.
/**
 * This class creates new quests and assigns them to heroes.  It also keeps 
 * track of pending quests and invalidates quests due to Hero death.  It
 * acts as a central place to catch army death events, and city conquered
 * events, and it passes these events on to the Quest objects it manages.
 *
 * This object equates to the lordsawar.questlist XML entity in the saved-game
 * file.
 *
 * This class is implemented as a singleton.
 *
 * @note There are some problems related to the signals emitted and received 
 *       by using the libsigc++ library.  If the QuestsManager detects that 
 *       some quest should be cancelled as a result of processing the 
 *       sdyingArmy signal, it cannot delete this Quest, nor can it disconnect 
 *       this quest, if this quest has connected itself to the same signal. 
 *       As a result when we want to delete a quest, we move it from the hash 
 *       of active quests to a vector of 'quests being marked to delete'.  
 *       Then we wait for someone to emit the signal sendingTurn and delete 
 *       all marked quests when processing this signal.
