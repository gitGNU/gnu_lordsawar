 * 
 * This is a map where you can select a city's vector, i.e. the position where
 * freshly produced units automatically go to.  They show up at the destination
 * in 2 turns.
 * VectorMap is the image in the CityDialog which provides a detailed view of  
 * the production of a Player.  It draws City objects on top of the graphic
 * that the OverviewMap class provides, but changes the icons over the City
 * objects to depict production.  It is interactive in that it handles 
 * mouse clicks on City objects and planted standard objects, but the 
 * behaviour of what the click does can change based on other calls to methods
 * in this class.
 * It can show vectoring by drawing lines between cities, and it can show
 * which cities are producing Army production bases, and which are not.
 * Clicking can select that City object, or clicking can set a vectoring
 * destination for a selected City, or it can change all City objects vectoring
 * to the currently selected city by vectoring them all to the newly 
 * selected city.
