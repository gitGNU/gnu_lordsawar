/**
   \brief The class to pass turns around the players during a hotseat game.
 
   \note    This class takes care of calling the correct players in the correct
            order. The problem is, no other class really has the scope of doing
            this whole stuff. The playerlist and the game object aren't the
            right candidates (they are busy with other things) and the former
            algorithm of each player calling the next one produces a huge
            stackload if two ai players fight each other. Plus, you want to do
            several actions at the end or the beginning of each player's turn
            or each round and therefore want a central place for this code.
