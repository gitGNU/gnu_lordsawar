Play by mail Lordsawar.

The idea here is that you're the game master, and you're setting up a game for other people to play.

1. make a new play by mail game
2. send the resulting saved-game file to the first player.
3. have the player send back a turn file.
4. run lordsawar-pbm saved-game-file turn-file
5. repeat step 2, until there's a winner.

As game master, you can modify the scenario as the game is played.  For example, you can load the game up in the scenario editor and inject new events like a flood, or an earthquake.

the game master needs to know who to send the file to first.
