Play by mail Lordsawar.

The idea here is that you're the game master, and you're setting up a game for other people to play.

1. make a new play by mail game
2. send the resulting saved-game file to the first player.
3. have the player send back a turn file.
4. run lordsawar-pbm saved-game-file turn-file
5. repeat step 2, until there's a winner.

As game master, you can modify the scenario as the game is played.  For example, you can load the game up in the scenario editor and inject new events like a flood, or an earthquake.

stack splits don't work
the split action refers to units by id that aren't there
even if i refer to the armies in the stack in a relative manner, i'm still depending on ids being aligned.

crashing in this case with an army unit that should be present
the unit id == the current id in the save game going in.
the army exists in the saved-game file after we move.
the army does not exist in the turn file that is created.
where does the army come from?

need to give the action produce, the army as it's produced, and not it's type.
vectored units don't get created! when done in an action produce.
