Play by mail Lordsawar.

The idea here is that you're the game master, and you're setting up a game for other people to play.

1. make a new game in the normal way
2. run lordsawar-pbm --init saved-game-file
3. send the resulting saved-game file to the first player.
4. have the first player send back a turn file.
5. run lordsawar-pbm saved-game-file turn-file
6. repeat step 3, until there's a winner.

defficiencies:
players have no way of extracting a turn file
players need to be able to start their turn at the start.
	e.g. to be able to receive heroes, etc.
