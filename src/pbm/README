Play by mail Lordsawar.

The idea here is that you're the game master, and you're setting up a game for other people to play.

1. make a new play by mail game
2. send the resulting saved-game file to the first player.
3. have the player send back a turn file.
4. run lordsawar-pbm saved-game-file turn-file
5. repeat step 2, until there's a winner.

As game master, you can modify the scenario as the game is played.  For example, you can load the game up in the scenario editor and inject new events like a flood, or an earthquake.

The files aren't sent automatically, it's up to the players and the game master to send files back and forth.
This allows for some flexibility: the files don't need to be sent in e-mail; they can be sent as instant messages, or in some other fashion.
On the other hand it demands that the user know how to find the file they just saved, and how to get it to the right person.
