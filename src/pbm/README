Play by mail Lordsawar.

The idea here is that you're the game master, and you're setting up a game for other people to play.

1. make a new play by mail game
2. send the resulting saved-game file to the first player.
3. have the player send back a turn file.
4. run lordsawar-pbm saved-game-file turn-file
5. repeat step 2, until there's a winner.

As game master, you can modify the scenario as the game is played.  For example, you can load the game up in the scenario editor and inject new events like a flood, or an earthquake.

*defficiencies:
does neutral ever get to move?
	does neutral get turned into a human player?

stack splits don't work
the split action refers to units by id that aren't there
even if i refer to the armies in the stack in a relative manner, i'm still depending on ids being aligned.

the white player made an army with id 1008.
but when we went to decode the action, there wasn't an army with that id.
the army in question was produced that turn.
the lordsawar-pbm program won't ever know about the army
unless the appropriate next-turn method is run
which happens in initTurn
but i can't init the turn for the player because there could be a hero offer in it.

this means that the produce unit action has to send the actual army
	which is probably appropriate
