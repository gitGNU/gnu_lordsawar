/** CitySet is basically an array of citys (terrain info objects).
  * 
  * It also contains some functions for loading and some additional items, such

  *
  * The image file for a cityset contains of the terrain images. Each terrain
  * has a row in the image, where each column has a special meaning (See
  * MapRenderer for details how smoothing works). Furthermore, there are citys
  * for special cases of diagonal adjacent water images. I hope to have a
  * documentation about map rendering and citysets ready soon after the 0.3.5
  * release. If it already exists, see there for further info.
