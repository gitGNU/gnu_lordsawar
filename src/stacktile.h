/**
 * This class is about managing a set stacks that share a tile on the map.
 * 
 * A stacktile object is a temporary object that holds a number of non-empty 
 * stack objects belonging to the same player where their total number of 
 * armies doesn't exceed 8.  The actual value is related to the 
 * MAX_ARMIES_ON_A_SINGLE_TILE constant.
 *
 * This means that there can be up to 8 army units belong to the green player,
 * and another 8 army units belonging to the red player.  Stacks of differing 
 * sides only share a tile when fighting.
 *
 * The stacktile object is not saved to disk, instead it is reconstituted 
 * based on the loading of stacklists.
 *
 * Like map backpack objects that exist on every tile, whether they have any 
 * items in them or not, a stacktile object exists on every tile whether any 
 * stacks are present or not.  the parent object in both cases is the maptile 
 * object.
 *
 * A stack doesn't know what stacktile it's in but it knows Where it is on the 
 * map.  game map has a quick lookup of position to stacktile.
