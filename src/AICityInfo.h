/** Class which contains some threat-related information about a city. It is

  * There are three important values:
  * - danger is a rough estimate of the strength of the stacks that are close
  *   to the city
  * - reinforcements is an indicator of the strength of the troops that have
  *   been assigned to protect the city
  * - the Threatlist contains a list of all threats (usually stacks) that
  *   endanger the city
  *
  *   See ai_smart.h for a comment about the smart AI.
