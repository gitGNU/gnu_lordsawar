//! The abstract player class.
/** 
 * This class does not yet implement an actual player type. Its purpose is to
 * provide an abstract class design which every player implementation has to
 * fulfill. Of each player class we demand the following functionality:
 *
 * 1. functions for _every_ action a player can do
 * 2. some kind of callback functions if the player has a choice (e.g. if he has
 *    conquered a city, he may choose between razing, pillaging and occupying)
 * 3. signals which are raised whenever something important happens
 * 4. an actionlist which keeps track of _everything_ a player has done
 *
 * The fourth point allows us an easy network playing scheme. After a player
 * has finished, all he has to do is sending his actionlist to the over network
 * players. Since every item which the player can touch/kill etc. (cities,
 * armies, ruins,...) has a unique id, the remote game instances can then
 * simply apply these action lists to their own situation.
 *
 * The third point allows us to dock other classes to every possible event. One
 * example are ruin searching quests which must be informed whenever any
 * player searches a ruin. Or the bigmap can be informed when a stack moves,
 * so that it may update its contents.
 *
 * The second item allows an easy coexistence of AI and human players.
 * Basically, an AI player just follows some kind of routine while a human
 * player uses gui interaction. However, this becomes a bit problematic
 * whenever the player may decide something. One solution is providing
 * callbacks for these cases. The human player then opens a dialog somehow
 * while the AI player overwrites the default behaviour.
 *
 * The first point makes a nice derivation scheme possible. It is possible to
 * divide the player types into a local player, who implements all these
 * functions and a networked player. The latter one simply overwrites these
 * functions so that the game status is updated for each item of the actionlist
 * he has been sent. Furthermore, with a local player having been implemented,
 * it is extremely easy to write an AI player. All you have to do is overwrite
 * the startTurn function with your own code. For every action you already know
 * there is an implementation in a superior class which takes off the burden
 * for the actual work.
 *
 *
 * Finally, the current derivation scheme is as follows:
 * RealPlayer derives from Player.
 * NetworkPlayer derives from Player.
 * AI_Fast, AI_Dummy, and AI_Smart derive from RealPlayer.
 *
 * The Ids of players are very specific.  The first player (the White player)
 * must have the Id of 0, the next player (Green) must have the Id of 1, and 
 * so on.  The Neutral player must have the final player Id.
 * If the White player is not in the scenario, then the Id 0 must be skipped.
 * There can only be MAX_PLAYERS players in total.
