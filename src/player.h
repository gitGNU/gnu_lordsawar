/** The abstract player class.
  *
  * This class does not yet implement an actual player type. Its purpose is to
  * provide an abstract class design which every player implementation has to
  * fulfill. Of each player class we demand the following functionality:
  *
  * 1. functions for _every_ action a player can do
  * 2. some kind of callback functions if the player has a choice (e.g. if he has
  *    conquered a city, he may choose between razing, pillaging and occupying)
  * 3. signals which are raised whenever something important happens
  * 4. an actionlist which keeps track of _everything_ a player has done
  *
  * The fourth point allows us an easy network playing scheme. After a player
  * has finished, all he has to do is sending his actionlist to the over network
  * players. Since every item which the player can touch/kill etc. (cities,
  * armies, ruins,...) has a unique id, the remote game instances can then
  * simply apply these action lists to their own situation.
  *
  * The third point allows us to dock other classes to every possible event. One
  * example are ruin searching quests which must be informed whenever any
  * player searches a ruin. Or the bigmap can be informed when a stack moves,
  * so that it may update its contents.
  *
  * The second item allows an easy coexistence of AI and human players.
  * Basically, an AI player just follows some kind of routine while a human
  * player uses gui interaction. However, this becomes a bit problematic
  * whenever the player may decide something. One solution is providing
  * callbacks for these cases. The human player then opens a dialog somehow
  * while the AI player overwrites the default behaviour.
  *
  * The first point makes a nice derivation scheme possible. It is possible to
  * divide the player types into a local player, who implements all these
  * functions and a networked player. The latter one simply overwrites these
  * functions so that the game status is updated for each item of the actionlist
  * he has been sent. Furthermore, with a local player having been implemented,
  * it is extremely easy to write an AI player. All you have to do is overwrite
  * the startTurn function with your own code. For every action you already know
  * there is an implementation in a superior class which takes off the burden
  * for the actual work.
  *
  *
  * Finally, the current derivation scheme is as follows
  *
  * Player
  *   |
  *   +--- NetworkPlayer (not implemented yet)
  *   |
  *   +--- RealPlayer (a local player, human players use instances of this class)
  *          +
  *          |
  *          +--- AI_Dummy (AI for the neutral player, does nothing)
  *          |
  *          +--- AI_Fast (dumb AI, tries to conquer the nearest city)
  *          |
  *          +--- AI_Smart (quite smart AI)
