//! An instance of an Army unit, an Army unit type, or an Army production base.
 /**
  * This class is the atom of every army.  It contains values such as
  * strength, movement points, upkeep, and so on.
  *
  * The purpose of the Army class is three-fold; an Army class can hold a
  * an Army prototype, or a production base, or an Army instance.
  *
  * The Army instance is the most frequently used purpose of the Army class.
  * An Army instance has a unique Id among all other game objects, has an 
  * owner (Player), and is included in a Stack.
  *
  * The Army unit prototype purpose is the second-most frequently used 
  * purpose of the Army class.  These types originate from a configuration 
  * file; for example: army/default/default.xml.  Every Army unit type has an 
  * type value that makes it unique among all other Army unit types in an 
  * Armyset.
  *
  * The production base purpose refers to the Army units that are included
  * in the City class as potential Army units that the City can produce.
  * This purpose is exactly the same as the Army unit prototype purpose, 
  * except it knows which Armyset it comes from, and it knows which Army
  * unit type it derives from.
  *
  * Maybe these three purposes will be split up into three or more classes 
  * in the future.
