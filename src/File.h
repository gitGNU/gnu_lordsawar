  * These functions should be the sole way to access any files. They will
  * automatically prepend the correct directory, extract the correct file etc.
  * This enables us to install and package LordsAWar (there is no fixed
  * directory structure). To use these functions, you issue e.g. an armyset name
  * and have the full path returned, which is a file you can then load.
