/**
  * Class for events which do something during a scenario.
  *
  * This is the base class for events.
  * There are different events for different occassions. Each event connects to
  * one of the several signals which are raised when something happens. Such an
  * event can trigger actions which can be anything in the range from winning
  * the game to gaining or loosing some troops.
  *
  * The correct type of the constructor etc. can only be determined in the
  * derived classes, since they will want to be fed with different data.
  *
  * The classes up to now are:
  * EPlayerDead:    raised when the specified player dies
  * EKillAll:       raised when all players except one have died
  * ECityConq:      raised when the specified city is conquered by a player
  * EArmyKilled:    raised when a specified army has been killed.
  * ERound:         raised at the beginning of a specific round
  * ERuinSearch:    raised when a specific ruin has been searched
  * ETemple:        raised when a specific temple has been searched
  * EDummy:         never raised, can be useful in some constructions
  * ENextTurn:      when activated, it is raised at the next possible turn
  * EStackKilled:   like EArmyKilled, but here a stack must be destroyed
  * EStackMove:     raised when a stack moves to (a) certain position(s)
  *
  * Furthermore, an event can have one or more conditions which determine if
  * it is triggered. See Condition.h for an explanation what they do.
