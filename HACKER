HACKERS HOWTO
-------------

If you want to hack around the game we would suggest you to mail us,
so that we can channel our efforts to create one of the best
non-commercial strategy games for Linux.

Enough commercials :)

I am afraid, the documentation is currently a bit loose and being updated.
If you want to understand something of the game, have a look at the manual
(explains some concepts) and at the header files. They should be
documented quite well by now.
If you want to balance the armysets or something like this, there is currently
no documentation available. However, freelords uses plain xml for all data
files, so have a look at the current files, they should be quite
self-explaining. If you have any questions, mail one of the authors. Usually,
we _do_ answer _any_ questions, it is not as if we had no time. :)

Appendix: Some documentation can now also be found on our wiki.

Directories:
