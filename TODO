flying stack couldn't fly to a particular spot (endless loop)

buildings can be put on tiles that get turned into water
	or turned into forest
		true or false?

replace the following images:
	roads (x8)
	bridges (x4)
	cursors (x12)
	waypoints (x2)
	flags (x8)

hero in flying stack w/ dragons
has zero moves left, but the stack shows the next square as possibly reached
hitting space twice fixes it

fight bug:
	armies fight out of order somehow
	sighting 1:
	properties: 8 attackers fighting with 13 defenders
		both have heroes
		both have special units
		defender has 2 heroes
		attacker has 1 hero
	error happened on attacker
	sighting 2:
		8 attackers fighting with 7 defenders
		both have heroes
		both have special units
		defender has 3 heroes
		attacker has 2 heroes
		attacked from water
		heroes had same id.  this was fixed.

ai boats not showing up as in the water
	or maybe because one of them could fly

moves exhausted appears wrong when going through hills
