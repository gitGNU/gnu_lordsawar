fight bug:
	armies fight out of order somehow
	sighting 1:
	properties: 8 attackers fighting with 13 defenders
		both have heroes
		both have special units
		defender has 2 heroes
		attacker has 1 hero
	error happened on attacker
	sighting 2:
		8 attackers fighting with 7 defenders
		both have heroes
		both have special units
		defender has 3 heroes
		attacker has 2 heroes
		attacked from water
		heroes had same id.  this was fixed.


check to see what happens when i pass a larger attacker/defender list of stacks to fight.  it only seems to use 1!
---
moving the ai maybe* methods into realplayer, so that the smart ai player can use them
	maybe they belong in AI_Allocate
		the danger stuff looks redundant
--
ai_smart could have a scoreArmyType method as an input parameter
	so that it could have a different personalities
	needs to be used for what to buy and what to produce

when next to an enemy city, just attack it
calculate to city should be different for enemy cities
  friendly should go to the free spot that we can merge with
  while enemy should go to the nearest corner


bug: showing neutral battles *Again*
favour cheaper army units for production when we don't have much money
