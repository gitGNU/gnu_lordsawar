buildings can be put on tiles that get turned into water
	or turned into forest
		true or false?

fight bug:
	armies fight out of order somehow
	sighting 1:
	properties: 8 attackers fighting with 13 defenders
		both have heroes
		both have special units
		defender has 2 heroes
		attacker has 1 hero
	error happened on attacker
	sighting 2:
		8 attackers fighting with 7 defenders
		both have heroes
		both have special units
		defender has 3 heroes
		attacker has 2 heroes
		attacked from water
		heroes had same id.  this was fixed.


check to see what happens when i pass a larger attacker/defender list of stacks to fight.  it only seems to use 1!

moving the ai maybe* methods into realplayer, so that the smart ai player can use them
	maybe they belong in AI_Allocate
		the danger stuff looks redundant
--
ai_smart could have a scoreArmyType method as an input parameter
	so that it could have a different personalities
	needs to be used for what to buy and what to produce

when next to an enemy city, just attack it
calculate to city should be different for enemy cities
  friendly should go to the free spot that we can merge with
  while enemy should go to the nearest corner


bug: showing neutral battles *Again*
favour cheaper army units for production when we don't have much money
			   
retain game options through multiple scenarios of a campaign.
campaigns don't end well if we have a computer ending.
new GameScenarioOptions layout
	users are: GamePreferencesDialog, GameOptionsDialog
	newgameprogressdialog
	gamescenario, game
	need static access, because we can't pass it around everywhere
when we read in a file, it overwrites the options we have.
	so let's not overwrite
	it would require it's own section.
		and then we have to decide not to read that section in somehow
	we can just optionally read in those values from the file
	but the values should really hold the correct values.
it is only in special cases when they don't.
	what are those special cases?
	when loading a scenario/ new campaign, next scenario in a campaign
	how about on a random map?
		is fine on a random map.


use loadGameParameters everywhere it makes sense
	game-preferences-dialog

add campaign support in the editor
anywhere where we presume the order of the displayed players is in order of white, to black is wrong.
  as a result, preferences dialog is screwed if random turns is turned on.
  there must be other places too.
