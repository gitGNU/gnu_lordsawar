flying stack couldn't fly to a particular spot (endless loop)

buildings can be put on tiles that get turned into water
	or turned into forest
		true or false?

replace the following images:
	roads (x8)
	bridges (x4)
	cursors (x12)
	waypoints (x2)
	flags (x8)

fight bug:
	armies fight out of order somehow
	sighting 1:
	properties: 8 attackers fighting with 13 defenders
		both have heroes
		both have special units
		defender has 2 heroes
		attacker has 1 hero
	error happened on attacker
	sighting 2:
		8 attackers fighting with 7 defenders
		both have heroes
		both have special units
		defender has 3 heroes
		attacker has 2 heroes
		attacked from water
		heroes had same id.  this was fixed.


check to see what happens when i pass a larger attacker/defender list of stacks to fight.  it only seems to use 1!
