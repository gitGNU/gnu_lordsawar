	* AUTHORS: Josef is now mentioned as developer. :)

2005-06-14    <dr_maux@users.sf.net>

	* po/POTFILES.in: - remove ObjectList.cpp from potfiles

2005-06-14    <dr_maux@users.sf.net>

	* added dat/various/network_screen.jpg a horrible network 
          splash screen (needs better one from artists)

2005-06-14    <dr_maux@users.sf.net>

	* src/: netggz.cpp, netggz.h: - the other missing files for
	  client-side GGZ support

2005-06-14    <dr_maux@users.sf.net>

	* src/server/main.cpp: - adding missing main.cpp file

2005-06-13    <dr_maux@users.sf.net>

	* first implementation of GGZ suppor for the client 

        * basic GGZ handling in the server 

        * fix for undefined fd() problem

2005-06-10    <patton73@users.sf.net>

	* ObjectList: moved the code into the .h and delete .cpp
	  
2005-06-05    <ulf82@users.sf.net>

	* Quest et al: yet more review; purged a lot of functions

	* army/hero: merged the "getOrig*stat*"-functions into the
	"get*stat*"-functions via a boolean value to improve readability

2005-06-03    <ulf82@users.sf.net>

	* hills.png: added Phillips new hill images to test tileset

2005-05-30    <ulf82@users.sf.net>

	* Quest et al: more code review

2005-05-29    <ulf82@users.sf.net>

	* misc: more code reviewing

2005-05-28    <ulf82@users.sf.net>

	* TileSet: converted into a vector; fixed the black tileset bug

	* GameMap: there is no longer a need for a static tileset attribute

2005-05-27    <patton73@users.sf.net>

	* fixed the VERSION problem, it was related to paragui.h
	  that makes a "#unset VERSION" to avoid problems.
	  Fixed passin the variable FL_VERSION at compile time.
	* modified Makefile.am so that it installs freelords.desktop
	  and when we wil have them also the icons
	  
2005-05-26    <patton73@users.sf.net>

        * applied the second patch for ggzlib sent by Josef Spillner

	* added the support files for libggz
	* removed configure.in and added configure.ac
	* acinclude.m4 : added the missing macros for libggz
	* support for libggz is now optional (compile with --enable-ggz
	  if you want it). There is still a bug : Makefile.am in the ggz
	  directory still tries to install a file in /usr/local/etc/ but
	  i think it should not because you need to be root to do that.
	  Any clues for that?

	* misc: some more review/small changes

	  in the map not the relative as in the editor)

2005-04-22    <ulf82@users.sf.net>

	* army, hero: made several functions constant, some small changes with
	graphics stuff; this fixes an endless loop

	* misc: used const army pointers when referring to armies in an armyset

2005-04-21    <ulf82@users.sf.net>

	upgrading the city (this is not a bug of FL or of the Editor

    which would overwise show only black tiles.

    * GamePreferencesDialog: implemented different Terrain percentages, but
    it doesn't work yet, so don't mess around with the terrain sliders.

2003-05-19    <ulf@freelords.org>

    * GamePreferencesDialog, splash: integrated CreateScenario. Effect for the
    player: ruins now have up to three sometimes less strong inhabitants.
    ATTENTION: reloading a map (random.map) directly doesn't work. I'm still
    migrating the codebase to using CreateScenario.

2003-05-18    <ulf@freelords.org>

    * CreateScenario: (hopefully) finished the implementation, now I only need
    to integrate it

2003-05-13    <midramas@freelords.org>

    * mapdef: rename to GameMap and redesigned as Singleton instead of global
    accessable variable

2003-05-07    <midramas@freelords.org>

    * CreateScenario: didn't compile

2003-05-05    <ulf@freelords.org>

    * mapdef: added function fill, which fills the map directly from the
    MapGenerator, removed templelist argument in constructor

    * CreateScenario: continued work

2003-05-03    <midramas@freelords.org>

    * Configuration: fixed a bug that prevented the second configuration
    file to be read

    * TileSet: use File:: function instead of explicit image loading

2003-04-29    <ulf@freelords.org>

    * hero_offer: instead of using a python script, Hero_offer now uses a
    heronames file which is in the data path.

2003-04-28    <ulf@freelords.org>

    * w_edit: improved the hero offering, no more errors should occur with it...

    * Configuration: significantly improved handling of the config files. Now,
    first /etc/freelordsrc is read and can then be overridden by ~/.freelordsrc

2003-04-28    <midramas@freelords.org>

    * automake/autoconf: make install is now possible

    * Configuration: a sane config for users has been set (e.g. /usr/local/)
    & don't exit if a config file wasn't found. the standard config should
    work on all "make install" platforms

    * README, HACKER, INSTALL: updated

2003-04-27    <ulf@freelords.org>

    * w_edit: moved hero offer to another place and introduced dialog again

2003-04-22    <midramas@freelords.org>

    * .freelordsrc: configuration is now parsed from /etc/freelordsrc
    or ./freelordsrc (prefered). for documentation of and an example see
    doc/freelordsrc. This currently works only on linux, windows follows
    soon. directory structured had to change for easier installation of
    freelords.

    * load game: bugfix

	number of objects and percentages of maptiles

    * CreateScenario: continued work, implemented some functions

    * various small name and type changes

2003-04-19    <ulf@freelords.org>

    first (normally weakest) unit; when pillaging, the production is now
    deleted.

	some other cosmetic and small bug fixes

2003-04-18    <midramas@freelords.org>

    * Bigmap, SmallMap: cleanup, improved animation of selector

2003-04-16    <ulf@freelords.org>

    * MapGenerator, defs, mapdef: now using macros for maptile characters and
    variables for the percentage of the single maptiles in MapGenerator (needed
    by CreateScenario)

    * CreateScenario: played a bit around (not much done)

2003-04-16    <midramas@freelords.org>

    * bigmap: added animation of selector

2003-04-14    <midramas@freelords.org>

2003-03-02    <ulf@freelords.org>

    * xmlhelper: all data tags now have to start with a "d_" (done automatically
    when using xmlhelper), this is transparent to the user (i.e. automatically

    * MapGenerator: integrated the C++ MapGenerator from Vibhu Rishi (the

	compile)

2002-01-15    <midramas@freelords.org>

	* CityOccupationDialog, W_Edit: Improved occupation handling and
	razing cities works

2002-01-07    <ulf@freelords.org>

	over to the next player

2002-01-06    <ulf@freelords.org>, <midramas@freelords.org>

	* CityInfo: fixed a segfault when leaving the dialog

	* MainWindow: added a menubar

2001-12-29    <ulf@freelords.org>

	* w_edit: fixed a bug where a draw against a monster in a ruin counted
	as a win

	* defs: added some typedefs for the actionlist

2001-12-22    <midramas@freelords.org>

	* added new button pics from James Andrews

	As a side note there is only one viewrect for both maps now, which
	removes the otherwise needed sync function changed_viewrect().
	
2001-12-06    <midramas@freelords.org>

	all up! Removed the global variable *game_scenario

	* ported MessageBox for blessing in temple

	* fixed hot-seat mode

	* player: started to adjust it to the UML diagram

2001-11-11   <ulf@freelords.org>

	* path: complete rewrite of the whole class, paths should look finer
	and calculate faster now, ships are now handled correctly

2001-11-10    <midramas@freelords.org>

	* added class LocationList

	* cleanups in class W_Edit

	the CVS version of ParaGUI 1.0.0! This step was needed
	to enable needed features and improvements of this
	version

2001-11-05    <ulf@freelords.org>

	* path: added functions for clean removal of objects

	* stack: stack now uses these functions

	* defs.h: some changes in unit definitions

2001-11-05    <ulf@freelords.org>

	the repository

2001-11-04    <midramas@freelords.org>

	* fight: again fixed, because the dead stacks didn't
	get removed from the stacklist

	* splash, d_map, startup_screen, player_preferences:
	many interface simplifications

2001-11-01    <ulf@freelords.org>

	* fight: the hero bonus is now taken into account

2001-10-29    <midramas@freelords.org>

	* again many interface changes

	* stacklist: clustering removed and simplified

	* fight, FightDialog: big changes, doesn't crash
	and seems to work again

2001-10-27    <midramas@freelords.org>

	* many interface simplifications that aren't yet drawn
	in the UML! (stack, path, ...)

	* fight: simplified and doesn't crash anymore


2001-10-01    <midramas@freelords.org>

	* fl: the start script has been changed to accept the
	-l option. If this is set only the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	environment variable is set. Then the game can be started
	with ./freelords as usual! This is important for debugging
	with gdb, because it doesn't accept shell scripts as
	executables (UPDATE: DOESN'T WORK!!)
	
	* path: changed the Path class so that it now inhertis 
	list<PG_Point*> instead of using an additional variable
       	to hold the list! This simplifies the interface a bit. 

	* bigmap: doesn't need a path variable. removed.

	* stack, stacklist: the stack class has now a variable
	path which is in fact of type Path*. This allows each
	stack to calculate it's own path as it should be! 
	
	* armysetlist: Parsing the XML file seems to work now.
	Game can be loaded and crashes when trying to move an
	army.

	* added two new hill pictures instead of the old one (James Andrews)

	* maptile: implemented the new hill pictures and randomly choose which
	one to draw -> because the rendering engine is dependent on the pictures
	we get from James Andrews (and he has still not decided how to do them)
