This game is written for the pleasure of playing (hopefully) a fantastic
strategy game.

For developer information and ideas look at the TODO and HACKER files as
well as the various files in the doc subdirectory.

Please note that FreeLords is currently in alpha stages so don't expect
it to be a great pleasure to play :)

Last but not least we provided freelords of a tutorial game. (just use the
